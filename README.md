when: Saturday 10th April, 9AM - 3PM NZT

In New Zealand, we'll pick up and start our morning at 9AM. We Mob/Ensemble program, switching who is driving every so many minutes, usually 5-7 minutes. This keeps everyone alert and works well for up to about 8 people, but better at 4-5. Past that and we break off into more than one mob.. we'll be stopping roughly every hour for a retro and a break. We will continue to code until about 3 pm our time, at which point we will be joined by the first participants from India who will then continue on with the code retreat, until it eventually ends all the way over in California.

This also means that you can join or leave earlier or later. If you can only join for an hour or two, that's absolutely fine.
